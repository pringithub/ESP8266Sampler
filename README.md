This is a simple web server application built on the ESP8266 (specifically the MHacks9 Hacker Board (see mhacks.github.io) (thanks guys!)).
The application has a simple interface: simply click on any of the buttons and watch the ESP8266 board respond in style (Note: You may have to change the pin configuration to achieve desired results).
